## Dory

Excellent name! "Dory" is short, memorable, and friendly. Let's dive in and ideate on the project.

Here is a comprehensive list of features for Dory, followed by a clear plan on how we'll architect and build it.

## 🐠 Dory: The Feature List
We can group the features into logical categories, starting with the essentials and moving to more advanced capabilities.

### Core Manipulation & Conversion
These are the foundational, everyday tasks.

dory convert <input> <output>

What: Converts a media file from one format to another (e.g., MOV to MP4, MP4 to WebM, WAV to MP3).

Flags: --quality, --preset (e.g., fast, slow).

dory trim <input> <output>

What: Extracts a segment of a video or audio file.

Flags: --start HH:MM:SS, --end HH:MM:SS (or --duration 15s).

dory compress <input> <output>

What: Reduces the file size of a video with sensible presets.

Flags: -p, --profile (e.g., 720p, 1080p, mobile, discord).

dory extract-audio <video-input> <audio-output>

What: Strips the audio track from a video file and saves it separately.

### Content Creation & Extraction
Features for creating new content from existing media.

dory gif <input> <output.gif>

What: Creates a high-quality animated GIF from a video clip.

Flags: --start, --duration, --fps <int>, --width <int>.

dory thumbnail <input> <output.jpg>

What: Extracts a single frame from a specific point in a video.

Flags: --time HH:MM:SS (defaults to a sensible point like 10%).

dory from-images <output.mp4>

What: Creates a video slideshow from a sequence of images.

Flags: --pattern "img*.jpg", --framerate <int>, --duration-per-image 2s.

### Inspection & Utility
Tools for understanding your media files.

dory info <input>

What: Displays clean, formatted metadata about a media file (resolution, codecs, duration, bitrate, etc.) using ffprobe.

Flags: --json for machine-readable output.

dory scan <directory>

What: Scans a directory and provides a summary report (e.g., total duration of all videos, largest files, list of non-standard formats).

## ⚙️ The Plan: How We'll Make It Work
We'll design Dory to be modular and easy to extend from day one. Here’s the architectural breakdown.

### 1. The Foundation: Project Structure & CLI
We'll use Cobra to build a professional CLI structure. Our project will look like this:

dory/
├── main.go               // Main entry point for the application
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── cmd/                  // Cobra commands package
    ├── root.go           // The root command (dory)
    ├── convert.go        // The 'dory convert' command
    ├── trim.go           // The 'dory trim' command
    ├── compress.go
    └── ... (and so on for each feature)
└── internal/             // Internal packages, not for public use
    └── ffmpeg/           // Our dedicated FFmpeg wrapper
        ├── ffmpeg.go     // Core logic for running ffmpeg/ffprobe
        ├── builders.go   // Functions to build command arguments
### 2. The Core Logic: The ffmpeg Wrapper
This is the most critical part of our design. We will not call os/exec directly from our command files (trim.go, compress.go, etc.). Instead, we'll create a dedicated abstraction layer in internal/ffmpeg/.

This package will be responsible for all interaction with FFmpeg. It will have two main components:

A. The Runner:
A struct that knows how to execute FFmpeg commands. It will handle the low-level details:

Finding the ffmpeg and ffprobe executables in the system's PATH.

Running the command using os/exec.

Providing user feedback: While a command is running (especially a long one like compress), we'll use a library like github.com/briandowns/spinner to show the user that something is happening.

Capturing output and parsing errors into clean, Go-native errors.

B. The Command Builders:
For each feature, we'll create a "builder" function. This function's job is to translate user-friendly options into the complex arguments that FFmpeg requires.

Example for the trim command:

Go

// In internal/ffmpeg/builders.go

// BuildTrimArgs takes simple options and returns the complex FFmpeg flag slice.
func BuildTrimArgs(options TrimOptions) []string {
    // TrimOptions is a struct with fields like Input, Output, StartTime, EndTime
    
    args := []string{
        "-i", options.Input,
        "-ss", options.StartTime,
        "-to", options.EndTime,
        "-c", "copy", // Copy codecs to make it fast
        options.Output,
    }
    return args
}
This design is powerful because our Cobra command files (cmd/trim.go) become very simple. They just need to:

Parse the user's flags (--start, --end).

Call the appropriate builder function (ffmpeg.BuildTrimArgs(...)).

Pass the resulting arguments to the ffmpeg.Runner.

### 3. The Workflow: Putting It All Together
Let's trace the execution of dory trim my_video.mp4 clip.mp4 --start 00:10:

main.go executes the root command from Cobra.

Cobra parses the arguments and identifies that the user wants to run the trimCmd.

The Run function inside cmd/trim.go is executed.

It validates the flags (--start is present) and arguments (the two file paths).

It calls ffmpeg.BuildTrimArgs() with the input file, output file, and start time. This function returns []string{"-i", "my_video.mp4", "-ss", "00:10", "-c", "copy", "clip.mp4"}.

It passes this slice of arguments to our ffmpeg.Runner.

The runner starts a spinner, calls exec.Command("ffmpeg", args...), waits for it to finish, checks for errors, and stops the spinner.

A confirmation message ("✅ Clip created successfully at clip.mp4") is printed to the console.
